# GameCo Video Game Data Analysis
## Objective
#### As an analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which aims to use data to inform the development of new games. I’ve been tasked with performing a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

## Key Questions
#### GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights you can pull from the data but are specifically interested in these questions:

#### Are certain types of games more popular than others?

#### What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?

#### Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?

#### How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

## Context
#### As a professional data analyst, it’s essential to understand a problem, map it onto a type of analysis, use data to confirm a hypothesis, and communicate any insights back to the client. Producing an end-to-end analysis allows you to present your work while displaying your hands-on technical skills.

#### Most analyses are done using computer software, which will be the focus of this project, developing the technical skills that form the core of good analysis. While the project involves data from a specific domain, the individual tasks can be applied to any domain, highlighting your aptitude as a problem solver for various clients.

#### The goal is for the individual tasks to help you work incrementally towards your final analysis, breaking the project into manageable chunks and introducing you to the data analyst’s workflow.

## Target Audience
#### The audience for this project is the hypothetical company GameCo, specifically its executives who’ve asked you to gather insights. For a further sense of the “who,” please refer to the hypothetical stakeholder quotes below:

#### Vice President of Marketing: “We’re always eager to know which genres of games are performing the best so we can allocate our marketing budget efficiently.”

#### Chief Financial Officer: “It’s imperative that we keep tabs on competitors and what share of the market they’re gaining or losing. Part of how we communicate our success to investors is by showing how we’re able to grow our business in an area where a competitor’s business is shrinking.”

#### Senior Vice President of Sales: “It’s essential that we understand swings in the market. If one market becomes more dominant over time in terms of sales, we’ll want to know so we can make sure we have a sufficient number of sales reps serving that market.”

## Final Analysis Criteria
#### -> Must include summary stats on a number of variables.

#### -> Must include 3 different types of visualizations.

#### -> Visualizations must be clearly labeled.

#### -> Final project needs to be professional (i.e., something you could show a potential employer).

## Data Set
#### The data set covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios. This data was drawn from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/).

#### Important points regarding the data set:

#### It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from 1980 to 2016.

#### The numbers represent units sold in millions. For example, the number “1.2” represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.
